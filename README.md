# Percolation-simulation
The following code helps simulation of percolation in 2D lattices and helps determine the natural percolation probability in these systems. The comments in the code explains everything if you know anything about the topic. For more information about the topic I would refer exercise2.16 of Computational Physics - Tao Pang.
